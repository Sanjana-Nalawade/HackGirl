# HackGirlInspiration
Our inspiration for SavvySpot came from the need for equality and gender diversity at workplaces which have always been one of the major issues raised by many people. We wanted to create a platform where candidates are hired solely based on their skills and selection is not biased by gender roles.

What it does
So our project is a website that asks candidates to register with us and then takes in their resumes and stores it in a database. And then these resumes are presented to employers after removing their name and gender-related info and focus are only given on the skillset of that candidate. This allows employers to choose potential candidates only based on their skills and the scope for bias based on gender is minimalized.

How we built it
Front-End is built with the Django framework and the Backend uses a technology stack of Python, NLP, resume parser. The hack takes input at a resume and parses it to give the information to display the details of the candidate, also the candidate gets a unique ID associated with its resume. The interviewer can see the data of the candidate but the system won't reveal the gender of the candidate making the selection completely skill-based.

Challenges we ran into
We mainly faced difficulties relating to the handling of database and deploying our website since we were not familiar with backend development and it was our first time working with it.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being new to hackathons, we feel proud that we could come up with this project that could have a great impact on encouraging gender diversity in workplaces. And even though there are many places we have to work upon, but to able to present this within this short period and learning a lot of new things is one of our biggest takeaways!

What we learned
Firstly this entire hackathon was a great learning experience as it helped us improve our coding skills and helped us to experiment with many new things which we were not familiar with earlier. Through our project, we were able to use our technical skills to create a product that promotes gender equality in workplaces, a social cause that makes this a whole lot special for us. It has also inspired us to implement more of such projects in the future.

What's next for SavvySpot
There is a lot of scope for improvement in SavvySpot as it can be built as a full website and help in reducing gender inequality. It can concit database and a better GUI.
